Task 1:
1]Variable declaration rule: studied the rules for declaration of variables
2]Operators: Studied various operators in python namely Arithematic,logical,assignment,identity,bitwise,membership,comparison etc
3]List: Studied the datatype list and its methods like append remove insert pop  sort count,accessing,copy reverse and its properties(mutable)
4]Tuples:-studied how to declare tuple its methods like count index etc  properties like immutable unorders etc
5]Set: set declaration,properties like mutable,orderd,etc
6]Dictionary:- declation of dict,methods like copy index pop and use of for loop for accessing
7]string: declaration and use of functions like upper lower split strip replace ect
8]Numeric:- subtpes like int float and complex

TASK 2:
1]if stmt:- use of if statement to check a single condition in vaious examples like to check whther a number is positive negative even or not within a range or not etc
2]if else stmt: used to check two conditions in examples like checking a number is odd or even, greater or smaller,negative or positive whether a person and vote or not and other similar examples
3] if elif else:- to test multiple conditions at a time if the above condition  false then the next one to it is tested.Studied examples like to check whether a num is positive negative or zero result of a student and other similar examples
4] For loop: used for accessinng the elemnts in a list tuple and its methods 
5] while loop: use of while loop to print a sequence of number print tables checking a number is palimdrome or not armstron or not etc and other statements like break continue pass

Task 3:
1]break stmt: usedto control the sequence of the loop. Suppose you want to terminate a loop and skip to the next code after the loop; break will help you do that.
#With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
2]pass stmt:has no-operation statement, meaning it does nothing when executed. Its primary uses are:
#Placeholder for Future Code: It allows you to write syntactically correct code when you have not yet implemented the functionality but need to leave a placeholder.
