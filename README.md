Task 1:
1]Variable declaration rule: studied the rules for declaration of variables
2]Operators: Studied various operators in python namely Arithematic,logical,assignment,identity,bitwise,membership,comparison etc
3]List: Studied the datatype list and its methods like append remove insert pop  sort count,accessing,copy reverse and its properties(mutable)
4]Tuples:-studied how to declare tuple its methods like count index etc  properties like immutable unorders etc
5]Set: set declaration,properties like mutable,orderd,etc
6]Dictionary:- declation of dict,methods like copy index pop and use of for loop for accessing
7]string: declaration and use of functions like upper lower split strip replace ect
8]Numeric:- subtpes like int float and complex

TASK 2:
1]if stmt:- use of if statement to check a single condition in vaious examples like to check whther a number is positive negative even or not within a range or not etc
2]if else stmt: used to check two conditions in examples like checking a number is odd or even, greater or smaller,negative or positive whether a person and vote or not and other similar examples
3] if elif else:- to test multiple conditions at a time if the above condition  false then the next one to it is tested.Studied examples like to check whether a num is positive negative or zero result of a student and other similar examples
4] For loop: used for accessinng the elemnts in a list tuple and its methods 
5] while loop: use of while loop to print a sequence of number print tables checking a number is palimdrome or not armstron or not etc and other statements like break continue pass

Task 3:
1]break stmt: usedto control the sequence of the loop. Suppose you want to terminate a loop and skip to the next code after the loop; break will help you do that.
#With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
2]pass stmt:has no-operation statement, meaning it does nothing when executed. Its primary uses are:
#Placeholder for Future Code: It allows you to write syntactically correct code when you have not yet implemented the functionality but need to leave a placeholder.
3] continue stmt: used to continue the loop as like break stmt it does not terminate when the condition is met but it continue escaping the condition that is met
3]statistical user defined functuions: created function to find mean variance median mode skewness rane etc
5]logical user defined functions: created functions to sole logical problems like finding theeven or odd number,palimdrome armstrong suare of number area of circl etc

Task 4:
1] numpy 1: studied what is NumPy,different methods and functions of numpy like creading 1d 2d 3d arrays indexing slicing shape reshape datatypes in numpy view copy join spliting of arrays iterating search sort and filtering arrays
2] numpy 2: studied the random function used in numpy data distribution seaborn module random permutation noram chisquare binomial poisson logistic multinomial distributions .thir distribution plots using matpotlib and seaborn .generating randon numbers etc.studied ufunc(universal function) like add subtract multiply diff product sin costan antisin anticos anti tan radian to degree and vise versa,,lcd,gcd,hypothenius etc
